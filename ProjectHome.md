Disables the following in TF2:


- Overly obnoxious hats (ie. Dapper Topper, Towering Pillar, etc.)

- Obnoxious promotional hats (ie. all the baseball caps, max heads, earbuds, etc.)

- Obnoxious seasonal hats (ie. all halloween and christmas hats)

- Obnoxious unusual hat effects (ie. all of them)


How to toggle hats:


If you want to search the entire text file for hats, just do ctrl+f --> search for "wearable".

If you want to check which hats are disabled in the text file, just ctfl+f ---> search for "//".

If your TF2 crashes at all it's because you fucked something up in this text file. Delete the text file if this happens.
